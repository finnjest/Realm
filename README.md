# Realm

Realm is an advanced text manipulating tool that tries to cover all possible text processing operations via multiple compact modules.

The user interface is quite simple, it has four tabs and two fields, one for input text, the other is for output. 

You choose an option, tweak it as you want, hit the button and get processed text.

The program is written in [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), which means that it is fast and lightweight.

## Idea

There are lots of such LiNe-bReAk rEmOvAl tools out there online, but what if I need... more than that lol?

## Features

* Search and Replace + RegEx
* Suffix | Prefix Adding
* Whitespace Removal
* Line Breaks Adding | Removal | Replacing
* Lines Containing | Not Containing  Deletion
* Before-After | Text-Block Deletion
* Duplicate Lines Removal
* Empty Lines Removal
* Line Numbering
* Case Changing
* Lines Sorting
* Text Aligning
* Text Padding
* Line Repeat

Other extended tweaks (case sensitivity, whole words, etc) are available for each module.
## Installation

You can download [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and launch realm.ahk file directly or simply download the executable (realm.exe) file and run it.

Realm is totally portable, it doesn't even write any settings to .ini file.

## Development Process 

The tool is pretty much finished, but there are other modules and features that can be possibly added, like manipulating "columns" and so on. There are no boundaries for such a thing!

I might also look into creating a help file at some point.

Credit goes to all AHK Forums Community, since I do surf forums a lot and might have taken some pieces of code from there. You guys are awesome!
